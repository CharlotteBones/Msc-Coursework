These Courseworks were centered around making a life stage calculator program from CW 1 relying on just if statements
CW 2 using functions and lists with some error checking, CW 3 using more functions with the addition of try and excepts
and the ability to read and write files and finally CW 4 to create a simple GUI with tkinter for it.
