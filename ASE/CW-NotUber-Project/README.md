The NotUber Project was a three part Coursework for the ASE module as a portfolio piece.  The goal was to make a 
fullstack app for a fictional hail and ride service with Google maps API, a front end booking system 
( Using longditued and latitude inputs ), and a back end with a Mongo DB connection.  
I spent about a month developing the entire thing with two weeks on Part II.

Part I - map folder, to have a full screen map using Google API with some custom car markers.

Part II - CW-NotUber-Project folder, the front end, I was provided a back end to test calls and make the car markers move, 
          enable a user to book the nearest car, view if they were booked and to cancel all cars.
          
Part III - server and test folders, the back end, to replace the back end and API I was given in Part II
           with my own, the test folder was not required but I used it to develop calls to MongoDB.
           
Languages used - Javascript, Node.js, HTML, CSS

Tools used - Google Maps API, MongoDB, Mocha, Postman


NOTES -
I removed all Keys to Google Maps API and MongoDB so they will need new keys to work.
